The dance is improvised and involves "repeatedly shuffling your feet inwards, then outwards, while thrusting your arms up and down, or side to side, in time with the beat". Other moves can be incorporated including 360-degree spins and jumps and slides.Popular Melbourne clubs during the dance's heyday included Chasers, Heat, Mercury Lounge, Viper, Two Tribes and PHD.[1]The origins of the name “Melbourne Shuffle” square measure unknown. The term was 1st delivered to the general public attention by Sonic Animation’s Prince Rupert Keiller throughout a TV interview in Sydney.

  <h2 class="subhead">How Shuffle Came Into Existence</h2>
  <p class="smalltext">The Melbourne Shuffle dance vogue has remained relatively underground since its birth among the late ’80s and early ’90s. The term “Melbourne Shuffle” was recorded among the media once Sonic Animation’s Prince Rupert Keiller was interviewed by Rage, degree all-night Australian music TV program. The inquirer asked Prince Rupert what his distinctive sort of dance was and also the reply was “the Melbourne Shuffle”. In Dec 2002 The Age, associate degree Australian newspaper, created mention of the term during a front-page article, making an attempt parenthetically what the popular Melbourne Shuffle was for the primary time to the thought public.

     <h1 id="kathak" class="bigtext">ALL ABOUT KATHAK</h1>
     <h2 class="subhead">History Of Kathak</h2>
     <p class="smalltext">Kathak is one the eight classical dance forms in India. The name itself is derived from the Sanskrit word – Katha (Story). The narrator of a story is called Katthaka in Sanskrit. Hence this dance form which narrates a story through the expressions and body movements came to be called Kathak.
        It was during the Mughal era; in 16th century A.D. that Kathak received Royal patronage and was performed in the courts to entertain the Royals. During this period, Kathak received elements of fusion from other dance forms like the Persian dance form wherein the art of straight leg movements was introduced as also the spinning movement.During early 20th century, Kalka Prasad Maharaj, a decendent of Thakur Prasad Maharaj brought Kathak back on to the world stage. His work was carried forward by his following generations.</p>
     </p>
     <h2 class="subhead">Styles</h2>
     <p class="smalltext">Notably, there are two styles of performing Kathak. The first one is Nritta which has a structure of pure dance in which the performances moves from slow to a faster pace and then reaching a crescendo at the climax. It often has two kinds of compositions. The shorter ones are called tukra and the longer pieces are known as toda.

        The second style is called Nritya which focuses on expressions as the main mode. This style uses pieces of expressions to convey a story. This performance style is also known Bhaav Bataanaa. The modern day Kathak uses more of Nritya style.

     <h1 id="ballet" class="bigtext">ALL ABOUT BALLET</h1>
     <h2 class="subhead">History Of Ballet</h2>
     <p class="smalltext">Ballet traces its origins to the Italian Renaissance, when it was developed as a court entertainment. During the 15th and 16th centuries the dance technique became formalized. The epicentre of the art moved to France following the marriage of the Italian-born aristocrat Catherine de Médicis to Henry II of France. A court musician and choreographer named Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx devised Ballet comique de la reine . “The Queen’s Comic Ballet”), which inaugurated a long tradition of court ballets in France that reached its peak under Louis XIV in the mid-17th century.
     </p>
     <h2 class="subhead">Styles</h2>
     <p class="smalltext">Classical ballet is based on traditional ballet technique and vocabulary.Different styles have emerged in different countries, such as French ballet, Italian ballet, English ballet, and Russian ballet. Several of the classical ballet styles are associated with specific training methods, typically named after their creators (see below). The Royal Academy of Dance method is a ballet technique and training system that was founded by a diverse group of ballet dancers. 
      <br> <br><br>Romantic ballet was an artistic movement of classical ballet and several productions remain in the classical repertoire today. The Romantic era was marked by the emergence of pointe work, the dominance of female dancers, and longer, flowy tutus that attempt to exemplify softness and a delicate aura.[5] This movement occurred during the early to mid-nineteenth century (the Romantic era) and featured themes that emphasized intense emotion as a source of aesthetic experience. The plots of many romantic ballets revolved around spirit women (sylphs, wilis, and ghosts) who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men.<br> <br><br>Contemporary ballets may include mime and acting, and are usually set to music (typically orchestral but occasionally vocal). It can be difficult to differentiate this form from neoclassical or modern ballet.
